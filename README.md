# DataStructures



// TODO 

1. What abstract data structures you implemented and a general summary of how they are implemented. For example, specify the growth factor of your dynamically sized array, specify what kind of self-balancing binary search tree you used, mention any data structures you used to implement other data structures. Imagine that you are documenting your library enough that other programmers can use it.

2.  What needs to be written in the terminal to compile and run the program. If you provide additional files for the tests, then clarify that and say how to run and verify the tests ran correctly.


3. Anything else a student wishes to say. Put it here and not in the Canvas comments!
